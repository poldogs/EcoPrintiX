This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install and set up the application.
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Requirements

Make sure to have the following requirements installed:

- Node.js: You will need Node.js to run the application. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm, yarn o pnpm: These are package managers for Node.js, and you will use it to install dependencies for the project.
- An .env file: This file is used to store environment variables that the application needs to function correctly.

## Configuration
To configure the application, you will need to create an .env file at the root of the project. This file should contain all the environment variables the application needs to function correctly.

Here is an example of how your .env file structure could look:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = your_text
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = your_text

NEXTAUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = your_text

DATABASE_URL = "your_text"

GITHUB_ID = your_text
GITHUB_SECRET = your_text

FIREBASE = your_text

ADMIN_KEY= your_text

Please make sure not to upload your .env file to your Git repository. This file contains sensitive information that should not be shared publicly. To avoid accidentally uploading it, you can add .env to your .gitignore file.
